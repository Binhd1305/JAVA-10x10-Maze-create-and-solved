# sample of recursive algorithm to solve maze it-self
This program treats the maze as a grid of cells and uses a recursive depth-first search to find a path from the starting position at the top-left corner to the exit marked with -1. Each cell in the maze is either a wall (1), an open path (0), or the exit. The search method works by moving step-by-step through the maze and trying every possible direction: up, left, right, and down. When the search enters a cell, it marks it temporarily as the “current spot” (3) and prints the maze so you can visually see the algorithm exploring. After printing, the cell is changed to a visited marker (4) so the algorithm does not return to the same place and get stuck in a loop. The isValidSpot method checks whether a move is legal—meaning the next cell is inside the maze boundaries and is either an open space or the exit. If the algorithm eventually reaches the exit, it returns true and stops; otherwise, if all possible paths lead to dead ends, the search unwinds and finally returns false. In simple terms, the program explores the maze by going as far as possible in one direction, backing up when it hits a wall or previously visited space, and continuing this process until it either finds the exit or exhausts all paths.
